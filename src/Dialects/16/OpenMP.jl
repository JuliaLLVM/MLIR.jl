`atomic_update`

This operation performs an atomic update.

The operand `x` is exactly the same as the operand `x` in the OpenMP
Standard (OpenMP 5.0, section 2.17.7). It is the address of the variable
that is being updated. `x` is atomically read/written.

`hint` is the value of hint (as used in the hint clause). It is a compile
time constant. As the name suggests, this is just a hint for optimization.

`memory_order` indicates the memory ordering behavior of the construct. It
can be one of `seq_cst`, `release` or `relaxed`.

The region describes how to update the value of `x`. It takes the value at
`x` as an input and must yield the updated value. Only the update to `x` is
atomic. Generally the region must have only one instruction, but can
potentially have more than one instructions too. The update is sematically
similar to a compare-exchange loop based atomic update.

The syntax of atomic update operation is different from atomic read and
atomic write operations. This is because only the host dialect knows how to
appropriately update a value. For example, while generating LLVM IR, if
there are no special `atomicrmw` instructions for the operation-type
combination in atomic update, a compare-exchange loop is generated, where
the core update operation is directly translated like regular operations by
the host dialect. The front-end must handle semantic checks for allowed
operations.

Collapsed loops are represented by the simd-loop having a list of indices,
bounds and steps where the size of the list is equal to the collapse value.

The `alignment_values` attribute additionally specifies alignment of each

`taskloop`

scheduled to be executed.

The `lowerBound` and `upperBound` specify a half-open range: the range
includes the lower bound but does not include the upper bound. If the
`inclusive` attribute is specified then the upper bound is also included.
The `step` specifies the loop step.

The body region can contain any number of blocks.

}
```

For definitions of \"undeferred task\", \"included task\", \"final task\" and
\"mergeable task\", please check OpenMP Specification.

When an `if` clause is present on a taskloop construct, and if the `if`
clause expression evaluates to `false`, undeferred tasks are generated. The
use of a variable in an `if` clause expression of a taskloop construct
causes an implicit reference to the variable in all enclosing constructs.

When a `final` clause is present on a taskloop construct and the `final`
clause expression evaluates to `true`, the generated tasks will be final
tasks. The use of a variable in a `final` clause expression of a taskloop
construct causes an implicit reference to the variable in all enclosing
constructs.

If the `untied` clause is specified, all tasks generated by the taskloop
construct are untied tasks.

When the `mergeable` clause is present on a taskloop construct, each
generated task is a mergeable task.

Reductions can be performed in a loop by specifying reduction accumulator
variables in `reduction_vars` or `in_reduction_vars` and symbols referring
to reduction declarations in the `reductions` or `in_reductions` attribute.
Each reduction is identified by the accumulator it uses and accumulators
must not be repeated in the same reduction. The `omp.reduction` operation
accepts the accumulator and a partial value which is considered to be
produced by the current loop iteration for the given reduction. If multiple
values are produced for the same accumulator, i.e. there are multiple
`omp.reduction`s, the last value is taken. The reduction declaration
specifies how to combine the values from each iteration into the final
value, which is available in the accumulator after the loop completes.

If an `in_reduction` clause is present on the taskloop construct, the
behavior is as if each generated task was defined by a task construct on
which an `in_reduction` clause with the same reduction operator and list
items is present. Thus, the generated tasks are participants of a reduction
previously defined by a reduction scoping clause.

If a `reduction` clause is present on the taskloop construct, the behavior
is as if a `task_reduction` clause with the same reduction operator and list
items was applied to the implicit taskgroup construct enclosing the taskloop
construct. The taskloop construct executes as if each generated task was
defined by a task construct on which an `in_reduction` clause with the same
reduction operator and list items is present. Thus, the generated tasks are
participants of the reduction defined by the `task_reduction` clause that
was applied to the implicit taskgroup construct.

When a `priority` clause is present on a taskloop construct, the generated
tasks use the `priority-value` as if it was specified for each individual
task. If the `priority` clause is not specified, tasks generated by the
taskloop construct have the default task priority (zero).

The `allocators_vars` and `allocate_vars` arguments are a variadic list of
values that specify the memory allocator to be used to obtain storage for
private values.

If a `grainsize` clause is present on the taskloop construct, the number of
logical loop iterations assigned to each generated task is greater than or
equal to the minimum of the value of the grain-size expression and the
number of logical loop iterations, but less than two times the value of the
grain-size expression.

If `num_tasks` is specified, the taskloop construct creates as many tasks as
the minimum of the num-tasks expression and the number of logical loop
iterations. Each task must have at least one logical loop iteration.

By default, the taskloop construct executes as if it was enclosed in a
taskgroup construct with no statements or directives outside of the taskloop
construct. Thus, the taskloop construct creates an implicit taskgroup
region. If the `nogroup` clause is present, no implicit taskgroup region is
created.

`task`

The task construct defines an explicit task.

For definitions of \"undeferred task\", \"included task\", \"final task\" and
\"mergeable task\", please check OpenMP Specification.

When an `if` clause is present on a task construct, and the value of
`if_expr` evaluates to `false`, an \"undeferred task\" is generated, and the
encountering thread must suspend the current task region, for which
execution cannot be resumed until execution of the structured block that is
associated with the generated task is completed.

When a `final` clause is present on a task construct and the `final_expr`
evaluates to `true`, the generated task will be a \"final task\". All task
constructs encountered during execution of a final task will generate final
and included tasks.

If the `untied` clause is present on a task construct, any thread in the
team can resume the task region after a suspension. The `untied` clause is
ignored if a `final` clause is present on the same task construct and the
`final_expr` evaluates to `true`, or if a task is an included task.

When the `mergeable` clause is present on a task construct, the generated
task is a \"mergeable task\".

The `in_reduction` clause specifies that this particular task (among all the
tasks in current taskgroup, if any) participates in a reduction.

The `priority` clause is a hint for the priority of the generated task.
The `priority` is a non-negative integer expression that provides a hint for
task execution order. Among all tasks ready to be executed, higher priority
tasks (those with a higher numerical value in the priority clause
expression) are recommended to execute before lower priority ones. The
default priority-value when no priority clause is specified should be
assumed to be zero (the lowest priority).

`threadprivate`

The threadprivate directive specifies that variables are replicated, with
each thread having its own copy.

The current implementation uses the OpenMP runtime to provide thread-local
storage (TLS). Using the TLS feature of the LLVM IR will be supported in
future.

This operation takes in the address of a symbol that represents the original
variable and returns the address of its TLS. All occurrences of
threadprivate variables in a parallel region should use the TLS returned by
this operation.

The `sym_addr` refers to the address of the symbol, which is a pointer to
the original variable.

"""
`wsloop`

The worksharing-loop construct specifies that the iterations of the loop(s)
will be executed in parallel by threads in the current context. These
iterations are spread across threads that already exist in the enclosing
parallel region. The lower and upper bounds specify a half-open range: the
range includes the lower bound but does not include the upper bound. If the
`inclusive` attribute is specified then the upper bound is also included.

The body region can contain any number of blocks. The region is terminated
by \"omp.yield\" instruction without operands.

```
omp.wsloop <clauses>
for (%i1, %i2) : index = (%c0, %c0) to (%c10, %c10) step (%c1, %c1) {
  %a = load %arrA[%i1, %i2] : memref<?x?xf32>
  %b = load %arrB[%i1, %i2] : memref<?x?xf32>
  %sum = arith.addf %a, %b : f32
  store %sum, %arrC[%i1, %i2] : memref<?x?xf32>
  omp.yield
}
```

The `linear_step_vars` operand additionally specifies the step for each
associated linear operand. Note that the `linear_vars` and
`linear_step_vars` variadic lists should contain the same number of
elements.

Reductions can be performed in a worksharing-loop by specifying reduction
accumulator variables in `reduction_vars` and symbols referring to reduction
declarations in the `reductions` attribute. Each reduction is identified
by the accumulator it uses and accumulators must not be repeated in the same
reduction. The `omp.reduction` operation accepts the accumulator and a
partial value which is considered to be produced by the current loop
iteration for the given reduction. If multiple values are produced for the
same accumulator, i.e. there are multiple `omp.reduction`s, the last value
is taken. The reduction declaration specifies how to combine the values from
each iteration into the final value, which is available in the accumulator
after the loop completes.

The optional `schedule_val` attribute specifies the loop schedule for this
loop, determining how the loop is distributed across the parallel threads.
The optional `schedule_chunk_var` associated with this determines further
controls this distribution.

Collapsed loops are represented by the worksharing-loop having a list of
indices, bounds and steps where the size of the list is equal to the
collapse value.

The `nowait` attribute, when present, signifies that there should be no
implicit barrier at the end of the loop.

The optional `ordered_val` attribute specifies how many loops are associated
with the worksharing-loop construct. The value of zero refers to the ordered
clause specified without parameter.

The optional `order` attribute specifies which order the iterations of the
associate loops are executed in. Currently the only option for this
attribute is \"concurrent\".
